          Things to know to get started:
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can switch to <b>Info Mode</b> by pressing <b>"I"</b> on your
              keyboard or through the "Help" section in the header. While in
              Info Mode you can click the elements on the screen to see their
              purpose or functionality.
            </li>

              following
              <b>"File -{'>'} Import Graph"</b>, then follwoing the path where
              your app is downloaded into. Find <b>"Samples"</b> folder and try

            <li>
              The visualiser offers <b>7 different algorithms</b> to see in
              action as well as weight-randomization, switching graph's mode
              between directed and undirected, creating new nodes and edges, and
              controlling the algorithm's aimations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Enjoy and explore!
